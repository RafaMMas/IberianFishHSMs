# IberianFishHSMs 

<div style="text-align: justify;">

**IberianFishHSMs**: A comprehensive compilation of models and tools designed to assess the habitat suitability at the microhabitat scale for Iberian freshwater fish species. The modelling approaches include a variety of techniques, such as Habitat Suitability Curves (HSCs) [@Waters1976], Artificial Neural Networks (Multilayer Perceptron ensembles, ANN-MLPs) [@Hansen1990], Random Forests (RFs) [@Breiman2001], Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) [@Hastie1990], and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [@Vapnik1995; @Cortes1995], all based on empirical data gathered from several river basins across the Iberian Peninsula. The HSCs have been validated by an expert panel, who contributed to the development of the package. Additionally, the package includes further sets of HSCs and Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBSs) [@Zadeh1965; @Takagi1985], which were developed from both the literature and expert knowledge collected through online surveys. The authors express their gratitude to the respondents for their valuable contributions. The package also provides functions for evaluating the microhabitat suitability based on hydraulic simulations, as well as tools for visualizing the modelled microhabitat preferences and suitability. A detailed example showcasing the package’s capabilities is included in the following manual. In total, the package comprises 797 microhabitat suitability models, covering 41 species across up to 4 size classes (Large, Medium, Small, Very Small) and spawning/nesting suitability (available for brown trout *Salmo trutta* and Atlantic salmon *Salmo salar*). The package also includes several generic models for fry (Cyprinidae). The development of these microhabitat suitability models leverage the functions and features of the following packages:

## Funding

<div style="text-align: justify;">
`IberianFishHSMs` was funded and commissioned to TRAGSATEC - SEPI by the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO) (Spanish Government). The data collection and development of the package were carried out as part of the project titled *Actualización y/o creación de curvas de idoneidad del hábitat físico para diversas especies acuáticas y ribereñas*, which was conducted under the framework of the *Servicio técnico para el desarrollo de modelos numéricos integrados e impulso a la restauración fluvial en las distintas demarcaciones hidrográficas intercomunitarias* (21.804-0047/0411).
</div>

```{r, eval = F, echo = F, fig.align='right'}
knitr::include_graphics("./man/figures/logo.png")
```

<br/>

## Installation

IberianFishHSMs can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RafaMMas/IberianFishHSMs")
```

<br/>

## Example
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The following example illustrates the capabilities of IberianFishHSMs and the general workflow for predicting microhabitat suitability using outputs from hydraulic simulations and field data. Field data includes the substrate and cover (shelter) distribution across the study site, by patch, pixel or cell. The data used in this example is available from the package and has been adapted from the data published in Muñoz-Mas et al. [-@Munoz-Mas2024].
</div>

```{r load package, echo = TRUE}
library(IberianFishHSMs)
```

<br/>

### ListModels - List available models and their key characteristics

<div style="text-align: justify;">
`ListModels` allows inspecting the available models. The queries can be categorized by *Species*, *Size*, *River*, *Model.type*, *Sampled.season*, *Valid.season*, and/or *Data.origin*. This function also provides the *Codes* to internally call the microhabitat suitability models during the habitat evaluation to obtain the suitability associated to each microhabitat (i.e., patch, pixel or cell). The output of this function also renders a summary of their main characteristics, including sample sizes, and several performance criteria for those models optimised through cross-validation. The argument *Default* = *TRUE* provides those models recommended by the expert panel who co-authored the package. These models are, consequently, the best option among the available models, but the additional models have been included to allow site-specific studies. The following example shows the default output for brown trout (*Salmo trutta*). From columns #1 to #15 the general characteristics are described. Columns #16 to #23 include the aforementioned performance indices. The output of this function is a three-elements list. The last two elements are the models' names and codes. These names summarise the characteristics of each model in the table and, as indicated above, codes are used to internally call the models compiled in the package.
</div>

```{r ListModels, echo = TRUE}
Selected.models <- ListModels(Species = "Salmo trutta", verbose = F)

## General characteristics
Selected.models$Current.summary.table[,1:15]

## Performance

Selected.models$Current.summary.table[,16:23]

## Models and Codes

Selected.models[2:3]

```

<div style="text-align: justify;">
`ListModels` output values can be used directly within `PredictHabitatSuitability` to carry out habitat evaluations. In particular, `$Codes` contains the names used to store and internally call the available microhabitat suitability models.  
</div>

<br/>

### ListSelectedCoverTypes - List selected cover types in each microhabitat suitability model

<div style="text-align: justify;">
An interaction exists between the training data and the selected modeling technique, which can influence the effect and/or importance of predictor variables [@Eugster2014]. Through cross-validation, we performed a variable selection process during the development of microhabitat suitability models, discarding those cover types that did not improve model performance. This approach was applied to both Machine Learning models (i.e., ANN-MLPs, RFs, SVMs) and statistical methods (i.e., GAMs). A similar procedure was followed in the development of the Habitat Suitability Curves/Criteria (HSCs) and Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBSs). This approach leads to different sets of relevant cover types in each model, although a core group of important cover types is expected to be shared across models. The function `ListSelectedCoverTypes` allows inspecting the selected cover types for each model. This will enable practitioners to discard some models when they are deemed inadequate. Likewise, the queries can be categorized by *Species*, *Size*, *River*, *Model.type*, *Sampled.season*, *Valid.season*, and/or *Data.origin*. When evaluating the microhabitat suitability, `PredictHabitatSuitability` selects and aggregates the appropriate cover types internally. Therefore, this function does not need to be called explicitly.
</div>

```{r ListSelectedCoverTypes, echo = TRUE}

ListSelectedCoverTypes(Species = "Salmo trutta")

```

<br/>

### PlotHabitatSuitabilityModels - Carry out sensitivity analyses

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The package includes a number of models (797) and species (41) across various size classes and activities. Among other factors, the available models differ in modelling technique, sampling site, and the aggregation of data from different locations and rivers. The ARGUMENT `Default`, in `ListModels`, indicates which models are recommended based on their performance, generalization ability, and/or development using data that cover a broad range of microhabitat variables. However, users can select alternative models when preferred—for example, when evaluating microhabitat suitability in a basin where data for a different model were collected. In addition to `ListSelectedCoverTypes`, users can conduct sensitivity analyses to compare the predictions of different models and choose the one that best aligns with their needs and expertise. This process allows users to assess model performance before selecting an alternative model or a set of models. Sensitivity analysis can be performed using the `PlotHabitatSuitabilityModels` function as follows:
</div>

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5, dpi=800}

## Pseudochondrostoma.polylepis, large, FRBS for Spring, Summer, and Autumn

(Selected.model <- ListModels(Species = "Pseudochondrostoma polylepis", verbose = FALSE)$Codes[1])

PlotHabitatSuitabilityModels(Selected.model = Selected.model, Quantiles = TRUE)

```

**Figure 1** - Sensitivity analysis (i.e., partial dependence-like plots) for *Pseudochondrostoma polylepis* large. The figure shows the results for the Fuzzy Rule-Based System (FRBS) to evaluate the microhabitat suitability during Spring, Summer, and Autumn (warm period). The different coloured lines depict the quantiles of the predictions along the range of the studied variable. 

<br/>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
This function generates partial dependence-like plots for microhabitat suitability models based on the provided data and selected model [@Friedman2001]. Partial dependence plots are created by varying one variable over its range of values while averaging the model's predictions over all the other features. In this case, the quantiles of these predictions are plotted. This method isolates the effect of that single variable on the outcome and thus determining the overall effect. The function allows employing a user defined dataset to test specific combinations of variable values. The function allows plotting the mean effect by setting `Quantiles` to `FALSE`. 
</div>

<br/>

### LoadAndPrintModel - Load and/or print a specific model

`LoadAndPrintModel` allows selecting any specific model and assigning it to an *R* object, as well as printing this model.  

```{r Load.and.print.model}
(Selected.model <- ListModels(Species = "Salmo trutta", Model.type = "GAM", verbose = FALSE))

(Selected.model <- LoadAndPrintModel(Selected.model = Selected.model$Codes[1]))
```

<br/>

As indicated at the beginning of this manual, each group of models was developed employing specific *R* packages:

- Habitat Suitability Curves (HSCs): `FuzzyFishHS` [github link](https://github.com/RafaMMas/FuzzyFishHS)
- Artificial Neural Networks (Multilayer Perceptron ensembles, ANN-MLPs): `nnet` [CRAN link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nnet/index.html)
- Random Forests (RFs): `ranger` [CRAN link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ranger/index.html)
- Generalised Additive Models (GAMs): `mgcv` [CRAN link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html)
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs): `e1071` [CRAN link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html)
- Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBSs): `FuzzyFishHS` [github link](https://github.com/RafaMMas/FuzzyFishHS)

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Therefore, once a specific model has been loaded, it is possible to harness the capabilities of each specific package to, for example, plot directly the selected model. The following code shows an example using the function `plot` from `mgcv` to visualise the effects of the smooth spline functions of a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) for brown trout (*Salmo trutta*) large obtained with data collected in the Curueño River (Douro) and valid all year round.  
</div>

```{r GAMplot, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4.5, out.height = "80%", dpi=800}
library(mgcv)
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1), bty = "n")
plot.gam(Selected.model$Model, pages = 1, shade=TRUE, shade.col = "dodgerblue")
```

**Figure 2** - Plot of the Generalised Additive Model for *Salmo trutta* Large obtained with data collected in the Curueño River (Douro) and valid all year round. ${\textsf{\color{blue}Blue}}$ band represents the 95% confidence intervals of each smooth term.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The different options to, for example, plot each model depends on each specific package and in some cases, such as the SVMs obtained with `e1071`, it will require indirect approaches for plotting. For example, using the *R* package `pdp` [@RJ-2017-016].
</div>

<br/>

### PredictHabitatSuitability - Microhabitat suitability predictions

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Microhabitat suitability predictions are carried out employing the function `PredictHabitatSuitability`. They are based on mean flow velocity (m/s), water depth (m) substrate index (-) and the sum of the number of relevant types of cover in the evaluated microhabitats (i.e., pixels or cells from the hydraulic simulation). The package includes functions to prepare the input data (i.e., `SubstrateIndex`). Additionally, the package includes data on a typical output from a hydraulic simulation and the data on substrate and cover distribution and availability from the field survey carried out in concert of the bathymetry. In particular, it includes data on velocity and depth for 40 simulated flows and the substrate composition and cover availability in the 400-m reach of the Serpis River (Eastern Iberian Peninsula) studied by Muñoz-Mas et al. [-@Munoz-Mas2024]. The data and subsequent analyses are intended to show the capabilities of the package and do not imply the species are present in this reach of the Serpis River or along its water course. For simplicity the data are stored in four separated files that can be accessed and loaded to the workspace using the function `data` as follows:
</div>

<br/>

``` {r Habitat assessment}
data("Velocity.example.df")
data("Depth.example.df")
data("Cover.example.df")
data("Substrate.index.example.df")

summary(Velocity.example.df[,1:6])
summary(Depth.example.df[,1:6])
summary(Cover.example.df[,-c(1:2)])
summary(Substrate.index.example.df[,-c(1:2)])

```

<br/>

In this reach of the Serpis River the water flows northward (upwards). The reach presents a series of small and relatively shallow pools connected through rapid waters (i.e., rapid/runs). The largest pool is located at the downstream part of the reach. The following figure shows the distribution of the velocity (m/s) and depth (m) for four simulated flows: Q = 0.5, 2.2, 2.7, and 21 m<sup>3</sup>/s. The maximum simulated velocity was 1.8 m/s and the maximum depth of 2.4 m.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Among the ten types of cover recorded and used to develop the microhabitat suitability models, in this river reach leaves, algae, roots, and sand were absent. The most abundant cover types were logs and woody debris (wood) and shade which covered most of the margins. Rock was the most abundant instream cover, especially in the transition zone between pools, whereas the remaining cover types were only present in small patches.

**Figure 4** - Distribution of each cover type along the reach of the Serpis River (Jucar River Basin District). The models were developed considering ten types of cover (refuge/shelter): Leaves, Algae, Roots, Aquatic vegetation, Reeds (emerging vegetation/helophytes), Woody debris and logs, Sand, Rocks, Caves, and Shade, which are included (but no necessarily present) in the `Cover.example.df`.  

<br/>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The function `SubstrateIndex` computes the substrate index as a weighted aggregation of the percentage of different granulometry classes (%). The substrate classes originally used corresponded to a simplification of the American Geophysical Union size scale, namely silt (Ø ≤ 62 µm), sand (62 µm > Ø ≤ 2 mm), fine gravel (2 > Ø ≤ 8 mm), gravel (8 > Ø ≤ 64 mm), cobbles (64 > Ø ≤ 256 mm), boulders (Ø > 256 mm) and bedrock (see e.g., Muñoz-Mas et al. 2017 or Muñoz-Mas et al. 2018). The package includes some examples to illustrate the structure of the input files.
</div>

<br/>

```{r SubstrateIndex, echo = TRUE}

Substrate.index <- SubstrateIndex(Substrate.index.example.df, check.completeness = FALSE)

```

<br/>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The substrate index ranges from 0, fines/silt, to 8, bedrock. In the example site of the Serpis River the upstream pools and rapids (bottom part of the figure) present coarse substrates, cobble (6), boulders (7) and even parts were bedrock (8) dominated. The finer substrates were located at the beginning of the big pool and the lateral margins of the reach.

In the example, we selected the default available models for Southern Iberian spined-loach (*Cobitis paludica*) large. For this species and size class there are seven models obtained from expert-knowledge and empirical data collected in the Estena (Guadiana) and Yeguas (Guadalquivir) rivers. The default available models include two Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBSs) obtained from expert-knowledge and literature (EKorL), one for Summer (warm period) and Winter (cold period). The set also includes a Generalised Additive Model (GAM), a set of Habitat Suitability Curves (HSCs), an Artificial Neural Network (NNET), Random forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). All these models were trained using data collected from the Estena and Yeguas rivers during the spring and summer. Currently, these models represent the best option for evaluating microhabitat suitability across any season. To select the models, we employed the function `ListModels` setting the arguments `Selected.species` to `"Cobitis paludica"` and the `Selected.size` to `"Large"`.
</div>

<br/>

```{r select model for evaluation}

Selected.species <- "Cobitis paludica"

Selected.size <- "Large"
  
(Selected.models <- ListModels(Species = Selected.species, Size = Selected.size)) ## example determining the selected models 
```

<div style="text-align: justify;">
`PredictHabitatSuitability` allows evaluating the microhabitat suitability of every patch, pixel or cell from field surveys and/or hydraulic simulations. The main arguments of the function are the selected models from `ListModels` and data on Velocity, Depth, Substrate index and Cover availability. `PredictHabitatSuitability` expects data to be a *R* `data.frame` with the following columns, which must be named as follows to ensure each model finds the necessary info to aggregate the relevant cover types and carry out the evaluation:

1. "Velocity"
2. "Depth"
3. "Leaves"
4. "Algae"
5. "Root"
6. "Aquatic.vegetation"
7. "Reed"
8. "Wood"

**If any cover type is absent the entire column should be set to zero, but it must be present in the dataset**.
Once the dataset is prepared, and the models are selected using `ListModels`, the microhabitat suitability can be predicted with `PredictHabitatSuitability`.

The summary of the predictions show that most of the models predicted suitability values along the entire feasible range from 0 to 1, but the statistics indicate differences among models. For example, the Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBSs) for summer indicates a mean suitability around 0.62 and an inferior value for winter (0.49). The higher value is similar to that obtained with the Habitat Suitability Curves (HSCs). The mean suitability obtained with the Artificial Neural Network (NNET) is markedly lower as it only achieved 0.18, whereas the mean suitability from Random forests (RF) was of 0.35. By contrast, the mean suitability obtained with the remaining models is close to 0.50.

By using the `pairs` it is possible to see the differences between each pair of predictions, the variable interactions, dependencies (The Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems, FRBSs, are based on the Expert-Knowledge-based Habitat Suitability Curves/Criteria, HSCs) and the compensatory nature of the different models. Colour code in the following figure ranges from ${\textsf{\color{red}red}}$, ${\textsf{\color{orange}orange}}$ and ${\textsf{\color{gold}gold}}$ to ${\textsf{\color{green}green}}$ and ${\textsf{\color{blue}blue}}$ following the typical colour palette to assess the ecological status. The associated suitability is based on the mean/ensemble prediction across models.

**Figure 6** - Paired plots comparing the predicted suitability for *Cobitis paludica* large employing the default available models. The comparison includes, Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBSs) obtained from expert-knowledge and literature (EKorL) and valid during Summer (warm period) and Winter (cold period). In addition, it also compares the results obtained with the Generalised Additive Model (GAM), Habitat Suitability Curves (HSCs), Artificial Neural Network (NNET), Random forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). All these models were developed pooling data from the Estena (Guadiana) and Yeguas (Guadalquivir) rivers. Currently, these models are valid for every season (*All*). The names and main characteristics of the models appear in the diagonal of the figure. Dot colours correspond to the mean/ensemble prediction across models.

The coordinates in the data included in `IberianFishHSMs` allows mapping the microhabitat suitability predicted with each selected model employing functions from the *R* package `sf`. First, it is necessary to create a point object with the coordinates and the desired colour sequence. In this case also ranging from ${\textsf{\color{red}red}}$, ${\textsf{\color{orange}orange}}$ and ${\textsf{\color{gold}gold}}$ to ${\textsf{\color{green}green}}$ and ${\textsf{\color{blue}blue}}$. Then, a loop plotting iteratively the different maps is carried out and the figure title is added.

The different models assign the highest suitability to the downstream pool (upper part of the map). However, the maps developed employing the preceding code reveal the differences among the microhabitat suitability models. The Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBSs) assign large suitability to the deeper areas and the shores of the pools comprised within the hydraulic model. Both of them predicted as unsuitable the rapids connecting them but the FRBSs for Winter is more restrictive than the one for Summer and predicts as suitable only the deeper parts of these pools. The Generalised Additive Model (GAM) and the Habitat Suitability Curves (HSCs) predicted high suitability in the deeper part of the upstream pool and particularly to the shores, but the upstream smaller pools were unsuitable with the GAM and largely suitable with the HSCs. The latter highlights the compensatory nature of the geometric mean used to aggregate the suitability obtained from each independent microhabitat suitability curve. The Artificial Neural Network (NNET) only considered suitable very specific areas of the study site. The Random forest model (RF) only predicted as suitable the deeper parts of this pool but, based on this model predictions, both margins would be unsuitable. The predictions of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) were similar but this technique evaluated the deeper parts of the pool with the highest suitability (i.e., 1). These models are based on the ensemble prediction of ten SVMs and it indicates the ten models predict these microhabitat as *present*.

**Figure 7** - Maps depicting the predicted microhabitat suitability for *Cobitis paludica* large in a reach of the Serpis River (Jucar River Basin District - JRBD). The maps show the predictions for 0.5 m<sup>3</sup>/s employing seven different microhabitat suitability models. The Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBSs) were obtained from expert-knowledge and literature (EKorL) and they are valid for Summer (warm period) and Winter (cold period) respectively. The figure also depicts the predictions carried out with the Generalised Additive Model (GAM), Habitat Suitability Curves (HSCs), Artificial Neural Network (NNET), Random forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). All these models were developed by pooling data from the Estena (Guadiana) and Yeguas (Guadalquivir) rivers. Currently, these models are valid for every season (*All*).
