abstract = {It is common knowledge that the performance of different learning algorithms depends on certain characteristics of the data - such as dimensionality, linear separability or sample size. However, formally investigating this relationship in an objective and reproducible way is not trivial. A new formal framework for describing the relationship between data set characteristics and the performance of different learning algorithms is proposed. The framework combines the advantages of benchmark experiments with the formal description of data set characteristics by means of statistical and information-theoretic measures and with the recursive partitioning of Bradley-Terry models for comparing the algorithms' performances. The formal aspects of each component are introduced and illustrated by means of an artificial example. Its real-world usage is demonstrated with an application example consisting of thirteen widely-used data sets and six common learning algorithms. The Appendix provides information on the implementation and the usage of the framework within the R language. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A fuzzy rule-based system combining empirical data on hydraulic preferences and literature information on temperature requirements was used to foresee the brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) spawning habitat degradation induced by climate change. The climatic scenarios for the Cabriel River (Eastern Iberian Peninsula) corresponded to two Representative Concentration Pathways (4.5 and 8.5) for the short (2011–2040) and mid (2041–2070) term horizons. The hydraulic and hydrologic modelling were undertaken with process-based numerical models (i.e., River2D{\textcopyright} and HBV-light) while the water temperature was modelled by assembling the predictions of three machine learning techniques (M5, Multi-Adaptive Regression Splines and Support Vector Regression). The predicted rise in the water temperature will not be compensated by the more benign lower flows. Consequently, the suitable spawning habitat will be reduced between 15.4–48.7%. The entire population shall suffer the effects of climate change and will probably be extirpated from the downstream segments of the river.},

abstract = {Competition with invasive species is recognized as having a major impact on biodiversity conservation. The upper part of the Cabriel River (Eastern Iberian Peninsula) harbours the most important population of the J{\'{u}}car nase (Parachondrostoma arrigonis; Steindachner, 1866), a fish species in imminent danger of extinction. Currently, this species cohabits with several non-native species, such as the Iberian nase (Pseudochondrostoma polylepis; Steindachner, 1864) and the bermejuela (Achondrostoma arcasii; Steindachner, 1866). The potential habitat competition with these species was studied by analysing the spatial and temporal overlapping of suitable microhabitats. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) were developed to model microhabitat selection and these GAMMs were used to assess the habitat suitability (i.e. probability of presence) under several flows simulated with River2D. The J{\'{u}}car nase will compete, spatially and temporally, for the few suitable microhabitats with bermejuela and, to a lesser extent, with small Iberian nase; conversely, large Iberian nase was of minor concern, due to increased differences in habitat preferences. This study represents an important assessment of potential competition and, therefore, these results might assist to better define future management practices in the upper part of the Cabriel River.},

abstract = {Function estimation/approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical optimization iti function space, rather than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitives highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},

abstract = {Damming and flow regulation ensure water availability during dearth periods, but they cause impacts on inhabiting biota and facilitate the establishment of Invasive Alien Species (IAS). Setting environmental flows (e-flows) has proven fundamental to ensure good ecological status of rivers, battle IAS, and sustain ecosystem services. However, ongoing climate change is further straining water resources availability and the fulfilment of e-flows in Spain, which has compelled River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) to include specific adaptation measures. In this study, we assessed adaptation strategies addressing land use and climate change in the Serpis River (Eastern Spain), based on increasing irrigation efficiency (i.e. moving from gravity to drip irrigation). The evaluation considered two CMIP6 climate change scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5) for two time horizons (short term 2015–2040 and mid-term 2041–2070), together with three land use change scenarios (changes in irrigated areas and technologies). Future estimations included reservoir flow releases, e-flows fulfilment, agricultural benefits, and changes in the suitable habitat and potential competition for two native (Eastern Iberian chub Squalius valentinus and European eel Anguilla anguilla) and two invasive (common bleak Alburnus alburnus and pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus) fish species. Predictions indicated a decrease in the suitable habitat for eel and Eastern Iberian chub, but the established e-flows will be ensured. Although the maximum benefits will rarely be achieved, on average the modernisation expected in the RBMP would sustain agricultural incomes in the optimistic scenario (SSP1-2.6) and for the short term of the pessimistic scenario (SSP5-8.5), showing similar effects than the ongoing redistribution of agricultural plots. Habitat and competition with invasive species will experience little changes due to the strong flow regulation, although the invasive bleak would prevail in the mid-term of the most pessimistic scenario. These results highlight the necessity of proactive adaptation measures beyond those described in the RBMPs (e.g. forest management or crop substitution) to increase water availability and sustain agricultural benefits, in particular for the most pessimistic scenario. They also underscore the difficulties to counteract invasive species through streamflow management under water scarcity scenarios.},

Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data. High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated.
