abstract = {It is common knowledge that the performance of different learning algorithms depends on certain characteristics of the data - such as dimensionality, linear separability or sample size. However, formally investigating this relationship in an objective and reproducible way is not trivial. A new formal framework for describing the relationship between data set characteristics and the performance of different learning algorithms is proposed. The framework combines the advantages of benchmark experiments with the formal description of data set characteristics by means of statistical and information-theoretic measures and with the recursive partitioning of Bradley-Terry models for comparing the algorithms' performances. The formal aspects of each component are introduced and illustrated by means of an artificial example. Its real-world usage is demonstrated with an application example consisting of thirteen widely-used data sets and six common learning algorithms. The Appendix provides information on the implementation and the usage of the framework within the R language. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A fuzzy rule-based system combining empirical data on hydraulic preferences and literature information on temperature requirements was used to foresee the brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) spawning habitat degradation induced by climate change. The climatic scenarios for the Cabriel River (Eastern Iberian Peninsula) corresponded to two Representative Concentration Pathways (4.5 and 8.5) for the short (2011–2040) and mid (2041–2070) term horizons. The hydraulic and hydrologic modelling were undertaken with process-based numerical models (i.e., River2D{\textcopyright} and HBV-light) while the water temperature was modelled by assembling the predictions of three machine learning techniques (M5, Multi-Adaptive Regression Splines and Support Vector Regression). The predicted rise in the water temperature will not be compensated by the more benign lower flows. Consequently, the suitable spawning habitat will be reduced between 15.4–48.7%. The entire population shall suffer the effects of climate change and will probably be extirpated from the downstream segments of the river.},

abstract = {Competition with invasive species is recognized as having a major impact on biodiversity conservation. The upper part of the Cabriel River (Eastern Iberian Peninsula) harbours the most important population of the J{\'{u}}car nase (Parachondrostoma arrigonis; Steindachner, 1866), a fish species in imminent danger of extinction. Currently, this species cohabits with several non-native species, such as the Iberian nase (Pseudochondrostoma polylepis; Steindachner, 1864) and the bermejuela (Achondrostoma arcasii; Steindachner, 1866). The potential habitat competition with these species was studied by analysing the spatial and temporal overlapping of suitable microhabitats. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) were developed to model microhabitat selection and these GAMMs were used to assess the habitat suitability (i.e. probability of presence) under several flows simulated with River2D. The J{\'{u}}car nase will compete, spatially and temporally, for the few suitable microhabitats with bermejuela and, to a lesser extent, with small Iberian nase; conversely, large Iberian nase was of minor concern, due to increased differences in habitat preferences. This study represents an important assessment of potential competition and, therefore, these results might assist to better define future management practices in the upper part of the Cabriel River.},
